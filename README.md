# DutchAuction_Dapp

This is a simple decentralized appilcation (Dapp) in which user can list its nft (only one) and sell it 



## Demo

https://dutchauction-seven.vercel.app/


## Features

-  By clicking on NFT button user will be shift to new page where he/she could check the owner of particular nft by putiing its id
- By clicking Auction button user will shift to new page where he/she will get all details about nft like the price,discountRate,start/end time of auction and user could Buy it by clicking on buy button

## Tech Stack
For frontend React is used

On the Web3 side, the contract is written in Solidity and compiled deployed using hardhat. 
 
For interaction with frontend ether.js library is used
## Limitations

- The most prominent limitation of this ToDo system is that it's proper functioning is heavily dependent on how it's going to be interacted with. The buttons are not turned off (i.e. made un-clickable) at any moment. So, if a participant decides to just go ahead and randomly start clicking the buttons in between transactions, the application is mostly likely going to report an error or even worse, it may crash. Therefore, patiently wait for the transaction to complete and the updates to appear on screen

- User has to give access to Auction smart contract to sell its nft then only this application would work else user would get error
